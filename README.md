# Password Generator

## Description

My name is Levina and I want to make a random password generator. It can contain special characters, numerical value, upper, and lower case. Yhe length of the password is also customable and the user can choose that suits their personal needs. This will then help users to have a sense of security in their sensitive datas.

## Getting Started

Follow these instruction on how to use the password generator:

1. Open the link https://levigun.github.io/password-generator/ .

2. The website will have a red button that says 'Generate Password'. Click on that.

3. A prompt will come out to ask how many characters to do you want your password length to be. You can choose between 8-128 characters.

4. A pop up will ask whether you want lower case or not. If yes, click 'OK', otherwise click 'Cancel'.

5. A pop up will ask whether you want upper case or not. If yes, click 'OK', otherwise click 'Cancel'.

6. A pop up will ask whether you want special character or not. If yes, click 'OK', otherwise click 'Cancel'.

7. A pop up will ask whether you want numerical value or not. If yes, click 'OK', otherwise click 'Cancel'.

8. aAter all the selected criteria of your password have been chosen, a random pasword will be generated on your display screen.

9. If you want to generate another random password, you can refresh the page a start ate step 2 again.
